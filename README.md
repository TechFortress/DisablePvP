# DisablePvP
This is a variation of the original plugin which allows you to only toggle PvP in GriefPrevention claims. I can't recall if the default was to allow or deny PvP though, so that might be different too... if someone can let me know that'd be apppreciated.

### Commands
- `claimpvp` - Toggles PvP in the GriefPrevention claim you are standing in. By default, GriefPrevention disables PvP in claims - this toggles that protection.

Toggle is persistent and are saved in the DisablePvP folder.
